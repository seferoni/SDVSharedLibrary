# Function

This shared library is used for all SDV project repositories and assemblies. Central to its function is a GMCM API that facilitates implicit setting construction through the use of attributes, which enormously simplifies GMCM integration and helps abstract away a significant chunk of boilerplate code that would otherwise encumber the entry point class of a given assembly.
